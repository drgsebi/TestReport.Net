# TestReport.SpecFlow
The project is to generate the report of SpecFlow test run and send the report via email. The report can show the total pass ratio, feature-based pass ratio and each test scenario context. If it is a portal UI testing and the test case fails, a screenshot will be captured in the test scenario context for that failed test step.
